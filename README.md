## Purpose
##### The objective of this tutorial is to accumulate experience in working with Texevier and RMarkdown. The tutorial was written in a README with accompanying R Scripts in order to neaten the process. The tutorial answers the following questions:
* Create a summary table showing the first and second moments of the returns of these stocks for the following periods:
+ 2006 - 2008
+ 2010 - 2013
* Calculate the unconditional (full sample) correlations between the stocks.
* Plot the univariate GARCH ht processes for each of the series.
* Plot the cumulative returns series of a portfolio that is equally weighted to each of the stocks - reweighted each year on the last day of June.
* See if including the GARCH11 conditional volatility series of SLM (ht,Sanlam) improves the GARCH11 model fit of ABSP (interpret the p-value of the regressor).
