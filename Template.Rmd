abstract: |
  Abstract to be written here. The abstract should not be too long and should provide the reader with a good understanding what you are writing about. Academic papers are not like novels where you keep the reader in suspense. To be effective in getting others to read your paper, be as open and concise about your findings here as possible. Ideally, upon reading your abstract, the reader should feel he / she must read your paper in entirety.

<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf. These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

References are to be made as follows: @fama1997[p. 33] and @grinold2000. Source the reference code from scholar.google.com by clicking on ``cite'' below article name. Then select BibTeX at the bottom of the Cite window, and proceed to copy and paste this code into your ref.bib file, located in the directory's Tex folder. Open this file in Rstudio for ease of management, else open it in your preferred Tex environment. Add and manage your article details here for simplicity - once saved, it will self-adjust in your paper.

To reference a section, you have to set a label using ``\\label'' in R, and then reference it in-text as e.g.: section \ref{Data}.


Writing in Rmarkdown is surprizingly easy - see [this website](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) cheatsheet for a summary on writing Rmd writing tips.

# Data \label{Data}

Discussion of data should be thorough with a table of statistics and ideally a figure. 

In your tempalte folder, you will find a Data and a Code folder. In order to keep your data files neat, store all of them in your Data folder. Also, I strongly suggest keeping this Rmd file for writing and executing commands, not writing out long pieces of data-wrangling. In the example below, I simply create a ggplot template for scatter plot consistency. I suggest keeping all your data in a data folder.

```{r Figure1, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

if (!file.exists(file.path(getwd(), "code/Example_Plot_Scatter.R"))) {
  g <-
  ggplot(data = mtcars %>% tbl_df()) + # All data must be tbl_df()::: class(mtcars %>% tbl_df())
  geom_point(aes(x = disp, y = hp, color = cyl)) +
  theme_bw() +
  # theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10)) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 10), 
        axis.title.x = element_text()) +
  ylab("y-axis") +
  xlab("x-axis")

print(g)  

} else {

  WD <- getwd()

# Load ExampleData using read_rds or read_csv from readr package:
ExampleData <- read_csv( file.path(WD, "data/ExampleData.csv") )

source( file.path(WD, "code/Example_Plot_Scatter.R") ) # Load a function from your 'code' folder. This e.g. plots scatters to your own preferences.
source( file.path(WD, "code/Data_Create.R") ) # 
  
}

```

To reference the plot above, add a ``\\label'' after the caption in the chunk heading, as done above. Then reference the plot as such: As can be seen, figure \ref{Figure1} is excellent. The nice thing now is that it correctly numbers all your figures (and sections or tables) and will update if it moves. The links are also dynamic.

I very strongly suggest using ggplot2 (ideally in combination with dplyr) using the ggtheme package to change the themes of your figures.

Also note the information that I have placed above the chunks in the code chunks for the figures. You can edit any of these easily - visit the Rmarkdown webpage for more information.

#  Methodology

## Subsection
Ideally do not overuse subsections. It equates to bad writing.^[This is an example of a footnote by the way. Something that should also not be overused.]

## Math section

Equations should be written as such:

\begin{align} 
	y_t &= c + B(L) y_{t-1} + e_t   \label{eq2}    \\ \notag 
	e_t &= H_t^{1/2}  z_t ; \quad z_t \sim  N(0,I_N) \quad \& \quad H_t = D_tR_tD_t \\ \notag
		D_t^2 &= {\sigma_{1,t}, \dots, \sigma_{N,t}}   \\ \notag
		\sigma_{i,t}^2 &= \gamma_i+\kappa_{i,t}  v_{i, t-1}^2 +\eta_i  \sigma_{i, t-1}^2, \quad \forall i \\ \notag
		R_{t, i, j} &= {diag(Q_{t, i, j}}^{-1}) . Q_{t, i, j} . diag(Q_{t, i, j}^{-1})  \\ \notag
		Q_{t, i, j} &= (1-\alpha-\beta)  \bar{Q} + \alpha  z_t  z_t'  + \beta  Q_{t, i, j} \notag
\end{align}

If you would like to see the equations as you type in Rmarkdown, use $ symbols instead (see this for yourself by adjusted the equation):

$$
\beta = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_{t-1}^2} \\ 
\int_{x = 1}^{\infty}x_{i} = 1
$$

Tables can be included as follows. Use the _xtable_ (or kable) package for tables. Table placement = H implies Latex tries to place the table Here, and not on a new page (there are, however, very many ways to skin this cat. Luckily there are many forums online!).

To reference calculations in text, do this: From table \ref{tab1} we see the average value of mpg is `r mean(mtcars[1:5,]$mpg)`.
