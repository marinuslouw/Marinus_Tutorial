 The following tutorial makes use of financial data from the JSE to build individual GARCH models from which volatility forecasts can be made. The tutorial also aims to improve the ABSA GARCH model's forecast accuracy by specifying the conditional volatility of Sanlam as an external regressor in the variance model. The \ref{Results} found that ABSA's GARCH model's predictive power is improved by including Sanlam as an external regressor.

<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf. These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Introduction \label{Introduction}
The objective of this tutorial is to accumulate experience in working with Texevier and RMarkdown. The tutorial is outlined in the accompanying README with the bulk of the code written in functions within R Scripts in order to neaten the write-up process. The tutorial answers the questions as outlined in the README document.

# Data \label{Data}
After loading our findata we inspect the 1st and 2nd moments. From table \ref{Moments-A} and table \ref{Moments-B} it is evident that our sample period from 2006-2008 differs greatly from 2010-2013. Upon closer inspection we can see that both the mean and median for the 2nd moment of 2006-2008 is more than twice that of 2010-2013. This paired with the maximum 2nd moment value indicate towards considerably more volatility during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) period.

Structurally we can gather from the skewness and kurtosis values of the returns that our period from 2006-2008 have wide and fat tails of volatility, compared to 2010-2013. Negative skewness for the period 2010-2013, indicate relatively more positive returns than the period 2006-2008.

```{r ShortTable, results = 'asis'}
source(file.path(getwd(), "code/Packages.R"))
Packages()
source(file.path(getwd(), "code/Moments_Table.R"))
source(file.path(getwd(), "code/Correlations_Table.R"))
Moments_Table()
Correlations_Table()
```
```{r figure3, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Pairs Panel \\label{Pairs}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.width = 6}
source(file.path(getwd(), "code/Pairs_panels.R"))
Pairs_panels()
```

Table \ref{Correlations} and Figure \ref{Pairs} above convey the unconditional correlations between the stocks as a table and a pairs panel.

# Results \label{Results}

The following section illustrate the GARCH ht processes of our ABSA GARCH11 model along with the ABSA GARCH11 model when an external regressor, SLM's conditional volatility, is included. 

The model coefficients in table \ref{GARCH-A} and table \ref{GARCH-B} highlight the significance of the p-values. Table \ref{GARCH-B} indicate that the external regressor, SLM's conditional volatility, is significant. Table \ref{GARCH-C} and Table \ref{GARCH-D} exhibit the information criteria between the two models. The results indicate that including Sanlam's conditional volatility possibly improves the model's fit to the underlying data [@Tsay1989].

```{r GARCH-A, results = 'asis'}
source(file.path(getwd(), "code/Packages.R"))
Packages()
source(file.path(getwd(), "code/Garch_tables.R"))
Garch_tables()
```
